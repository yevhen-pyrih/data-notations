 <message_body>To work healthily at the computer, it's essential to follow some basic ergonomic principles and maintain good habits to prevent strain and injury. Here are three important rules:

Maintain Proper Posture
Sit with your back straight and shoulders relaxed. Your feet should be flat on the floor or on a footrest, and your knees should be at a 90-degree angle.
Keep the monitor at eye level, about an arm's length away, to avoid straining your neck and eyes.
Use a chair with good lumbar support to maintain the natural curve of your spine, and position your elbows at a 90-degree angle when typing or using a mouse.

Take Regular Breaks
Follow the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds to reduce eye strain.
Stand up, stretch, or walk around for a few minutes every hour to improve circulation and relieve muscle tension.
Incorporate micro-breaks (30 seconds to 1 minute) to shake out your hands, roll your shoulders, or stretch your neck and wrists.

Optimize Your Workspace
Ensure your workspace is well-lit, with light coming from the side or behind the screen to reduce glare.
Adjust your screen's brightness and contrast to a comfortable level and consider using blue light filters or glasses to reduce eye strain.
Keep frequently used items, like a mouse and keyboard, within easy reach to prevent overreaching or straining your arms and shoulders.

By following these rules, you can minimize the risk of repetitive strain injuries, eye strain, and other health issues associated with prolonged computer use.
